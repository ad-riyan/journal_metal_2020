**This repo is use to host materials for the article published in Journal METAL, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Andalas University.**

In this repo, there is
* a `pyScrew4Mobility` module which written in python programming language and using Sympy library.
* a notebook that shows the use of `pyScrew4Mobility` module to obtain the mobility of four parallel manipulators (PMs), i.e. 3-PRRR, 3-PR(Pa)R, 4-PRRU, and 6-UPS. The first three PMs is over-constrained PMs.


### To use the `pyScrew4Mobility` module, one can find the in the Notebook.
