# A Python Module for Mobility Determination of Parallel Manipulators Using Screw Theory: `pyScrew4Mobility` module


**This repo is use to host materials for the article published in Journal METAL, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Andalas University.**

This repo comprises:
* a `pyScrew4Mobility` module which written in python programming language and using Sympy library.
* a notebook that shows the use of `pyScrew4Mobility` module to obtain the mobility of four parallel manipulators (PMs), i.e. 3-PRRR, 3-PR(Pa)R, 4-PRRU, and 6-UPS. The first three PMs is over-constrained PMs.


## How to use:
This is an initial pacakage for mechanical system using screw theory. Author has a plan to create a python package which based on screw theory. Here, it is shown how to use the `pyScrew4Mobility` module to compute mobility of any parallel manipulators.

1. If you do not have a python (python3) installed on your personal computer, you can download a python distribution from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) that depends on your operating system. 
** To use the `pyScrew4Mobility` module, one can find the in the Notebook.
